Here's some useful info regarding all of Liam's files! :)

First of all, all of these files (so far) are just code that was extracted from StoryDiffusion's python script 
(on their github page).

My goal in making these files is to modify them so that it becomes easy to extract and customize the keyframe images
generated by StoryDiffusion. 

This way, we can have a functional back-end where we have the images themselves rather than only being able to see
them through the Gradio interface (also provided by StoryDiffusion).
