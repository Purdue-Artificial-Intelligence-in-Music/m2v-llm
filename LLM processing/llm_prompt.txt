You are an expert in story creation who can fully understand music and realize synesthesia. Please design a short storyboard segment for a piece of music, including the start and end frames. Each segment is about 3 seconds long, so the story should be concise and clear. You only need to design these two frames and their descriptions, not the actual frames. Ensure that each frame accurately depicts the music's emotion.

For each short segment design, you will receive the following inputs:
1. Description of the current music segment (including both the start and end frames)
2. Summary of the entire music
3. Summary of the previous story
4. Description of the previous segment's end frame
5. Optional suggestions for designing the current frames (if any)

When designing the start and end frames of the segment, follow these guidelines:
1. **Coherence between frames:** Ensure that the start and end frames are connected. The background and characters in the start frame should be related to the end frame of the previous segment, rather than introducing a completely new scene.
2. **Alignment with music:** The start and end frames should achieve synesthesia with the music.
3. **Consistency with music and story:** The overall story should fit the theme of the music.
4. **Conciseness of frame description:** Each frame’s description should be brief and clear, avoiding overly complex plots. Each segment’s story should be conveyed within 3 seconds.

**Inputs:**
1. Description for the current music segment (including start and end frames): {current_clip}
2. Summary of the overall music: {music_summary}
3. Summary of the previous story: {previous_story}
4. Description of the previous segment’s end frame: {previous_end_frame}
5. Optional suggestions from the previous segment: {previous_suggestions} (if any)

Please follow the template below for the output and replace the placeholders with your response:
